# CardGame

This was a side project, where the goal was to make a trading card game in the vein of Magic: The Gathering or Yu-Gi-Oh! It is, in its present state, far from
fully finished, but it does support a decent number of features. It is currently text-mode only, and each "player" would play from the same console, but by running
the file TestGame.java in the TEST package, it is possible to execute the following commands:

play: Allows the current player to select a card from their hand, and place it onto the field, assuming they have enough "energy" to do so.
show: Prints out the cards in the current player's hand.
energy: Prints the total amount of energy available to play cards with.
health: Prints the health of the current player.
p1side: Prints the cards on player 1's side of the field.
p2side: Prints the cards on player 2's side of the field.
field: Prints the cards on both player 1 and player 2's sides of the field.
attack: Allows the current player to select a monster to attack with, and which of their opponent's monsters to attack.
quit: Quits the game.
